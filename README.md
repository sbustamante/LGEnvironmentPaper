DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here we make a study of the principal properties of the LG in a cosmological context. The 
principal objective is to find a coherent sample of LG systems in the unconstrained 
simulation Bolshoi based upon the properties of hand construted LG systems in the 
constrained simulations CLUES. We obtain a privileged environment for these systems and 
significant bias in some of their properties.
