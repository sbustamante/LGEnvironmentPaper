\begin{abstract}


We present here a study about the influence of the environment on the
local group (LG) of galaxies in the context of $\Lambda$CDM. In this study 
we use a large volume high resolution N-body cosmological simulation 
(Bolshoi) together with the most recent methods to quantify the cosmic web 
(T-web, V-web schemes); furthermore we propose a novel approximation, base
upon the minimization of the mean density of void regions, to determinate 
the optimal threshold value $\lambda_{th}$, which have been treated until 
now as a free parameter. 
Following the recent work of Courtois et al. (2013), where was 
found that the LG is located near to a large void, we also do an extensive 
study of voids, applying a FOF algorithm to find void regions and 
performing an analysis of their shape based upon the reduced inertia 
tensor.
Using the recent observations that constrained the tangential velocity of
M31 with respect to the Milky Way (MW), the previously established radial 
velocity, the estimated masses of dark halos, along with some criteria
to guarantee the gravitational isolation of these systems (Forero-Romero
et al. 2013-1), we select a set of halos pairs as a representative sample 
of LG systems in the Bolshoi simulation. 
We look for possible bias and correlations between the environment 
properties of each LG system and its kinematic and formation properties. 
Among our main result we find \SRKED{[summarize our results here!]}.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%*************************************************************************


The spatial distribution of galaxies describes a web-like pattern, the 
so-called cosmic web. Today it is understood that such configuration is 
driven by gravitational instabilities. ...



The study of the influence of the cosmic web on galaxy properties start 
with the seminal work of Dressler \SRKED{[reference here]} and extends to 
recent works using large observational surveys that look for signatures of 
the web into the evolution of galaxy populations. With the advention of 
more detailed observations and sophisticated computational models it is 
now within our reach to understand what physical processes dominate.



This makes  that the mass assembly history of a galaxy is deeply connected 
with its  position in the cosmic web. There is an extensive body of 
literature on the effects of the web environment on the observable 
properties of galaxies. 



This environmental study is also of paramount importance to understand the 
formation of our Galaxy. In our local neighborhood, the observations of 
dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way (MW) and the Andromeda galaxy (M31) 
show filamentary and disk-like patterns that can be linked to a 
preferential infall direction, very likely connected with the cosmic web 
where the Local Group (LG) of galaxies is embedded. 



In this paper we quantify the velocity shear environment of DM halo pairs
representative of the principal members of the Local Group (LG), the Milky
Way (MW) and Andromeda galaxy (M31). We perform this study in an 
unconstrained cosmological simulation from random phases in the initial 
conditions, and unlike previous works, where were used constrained 
cosmological simulations which have been setup as to reproduce the large 
scale structure of the local universe, we use directly observational 
measurements of the kinematics properties of the local group \SRKED{
[Reference here]} in order to build faithful samples of LG-like systems.



We pay special attention to the correlation of the present velocity shear 
environment with the assembly and the kinematics properties of the pairs. 
The motivation to have that focus is that it has been previously shown 
that the LG present in three different realizations of the constrained 
simulations have assembly histories biased towards early formation times 
and absence of major mergers (ratio 1:10) in the last $10$ Gyr. In the 
case of the kinematic properties, recent observational constrains to the 
galactocentric tangential velocity of M31 has enabled to establish how 
typical is the LG in a cosmological context \SRKED{[reference to 
Forero-Romero et.al 2013-1]}, that is why we focus here how a specific kind 
of host environment biases these kinematics properties.



%*************************************************************************
\section{The Simulation}
\label{sec:the_simulation}
%*************************************************************************


As it was previously mentioned, we use an unconstrained cosmological 
simulation, the Bolshoi simulation, to identify the possible large scale 
environment of the Local Group. This is a similar approach to the one already 
used by \SRKED{[reference here]}.



The Bolshoi simulation follows the non-linear evolution of a dark matter 
density field on a cubic volume of size $250$\hMpc sampled with $2048^3$ 
particles. The cosmological parameters in the simulation are 
$\Omega_{\rm m}=0.27$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.73$, $h=0.70$, $n=0.95$ and 
$\sigma_{8}=0.82$ for the matter density, cosmological constant, 
dimensionless Hubble parameter, spectral index of primordial density 
perturbations and normalization for the power spectrum. The mass of each 
particle in the simulation is $m_{\rm p}=1.4\times 10^{8}$\hMsun.



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Halos and Merger Trees}
\label{subsec:halos_merger_trees}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------



We identify halos with two algorithms, the Friends-of-Friends \SRKED{
[reference here]} algorithm and the Bound Density Maximum algorithm. The 
constructed catalogues also provide the basis for the mass aggregation 
history studies. We also include in the catalogues information about the 
substructure.



All the results presented here must be interpreted in term of host halos, 
without any information of the substructure. In particular the merger of 
two FOF halos corresponds to the epoch of first overlap, and not to the 
fusion and/or disruption of an accreted sub-halo with a dominant halo. 



The linking length is $b=0.17$ times the mean inter-particle separation. 
All objects with 20 particles or more are considered a bona fide halo and 
are included in the construction of the merger tree, this corresponds to a 
minimum halo mass of $M_{\rm min}=2.70\times 10^{9}$\hMsun in the Bolshoi 
simulation.



The halo identification for the simulation was done for XX snapshots in 
the redshift range $0<z<7$ more or less evenly spaced in look-back time.

\section{Algorithms to quantify the cosmic web}
\label{sec:algorithms_cosmic_web}
%*************************************************************************



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The tidal web (T-web)}
\label{subsec:Tweb}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------



The first algorithm  we use to identify the cosmic web is based upon the
diagonalization of the tidal tensor, defined as the Hessian of a 
normalized gravitational potential  


%.........................................................................
%Tidal Tensor
\begin{equation}
T_{\alpha\beta} = \frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial x_{\alpha}\partial x_{\beta}}
\end{equation}
%.........................................................................
where the physical gravitational potential has been rescaled by a factor 
$4\pi G\bar{\rho}$ in such a way that $\phi$ satisfies the following 
equation



%.........................................................................
%Poisson
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2\phi = \delta,
\end{equation}
%.........................................................................
where $\bar{\rho}$ is the average density in the Universe, $G$ is the 
gravitational constant and $\delta$ is the dimensionless matter 
overdensity.



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The velocity  web (V-web)}
\label{sec:Vweb}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------



We also use a kinematical method to define the cosmic-web environment in 
the simulation. The method has been thoroughly described in XXX and 
applied to study the shape and spin alignment in the Bolshoi simulation 
here XX. We refer the reader to these papers to find a detailed 
description of the algorithm, its limitations and capabilities. Here we 
summarize the most relevant points for the discussion. 



The V-web method for environment finding is based on the local shear 
tensor calculated from the smoothed DM velocity field in the simulation.
The central quantity is the following dimensionless quantity 


%.........................................................................
%V-Web Definition
\eq{V_web}
{
\Sigma_{\alpha\beta} = -\frac{1}{2H_0}\pr{\frac{\partial v_{\alpha}}
{\partial x_{\beta}}+\frac{\partial v_{\beta}}{\partial x_{\alpha}}}
}
%.........................................................................
where $v_{\alpha}$ and $x_{\alpha}$ represent the $\alpha$ component of 
the comoving velocity and position, respectively. $\Sigma_{\alpha\beta}$ 
can be represented by a $3\times 3$ symmetric matrix with real values,
that ensures that is possible to diagonalize and obtain three real 
eigenvalues $\lambda_{1} > \lambda_{2}>\lambda_3$ whose sum (the trace of
$\Sigma_{\alpha\beta}$) is proportional to the divergence of the local 
velocity field smoothed on the physical scale ${\mathcal R}$. 



The relative strength of the three eigenvalues with respect to a threshold
value $\lambda_{th}$ allows for the local classification of the matter 
distribution into four web types: voids, sheets, filaments and peaks, 
which correspond to regions with 3, 2, 1 or 0 eigenvalues with values 
larger than $\lambda_{th}$. Below we shall discuss a novel approach to 
define an adequate threshold value based on the visual impression of void
regions, furthermore we study other possible values based on other visual
features of the cosmic web.



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The cosmic web in Bolshoi}
\label{subsec:web_in_simulations}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------



Both established schemes to quantify the cosmic web depend on continuous 
and smooth physical quantities, as the peculiar velocity field and the 
density field. In order to calculate the necessary tensors, a discretization
of the simulation volume is performed, so all the properties are reduced 
to single values associated to discrete cells. According to this, we divide 
the overall volume into $(256)^3$ cells, so each cell has an associated 
comovil cubic volume of $0.98 \mbox{ Mpc h}^{-1}$. Finally, in order to 
reduce possible effects due to the discretization process, a gaussian 
softening is performed between neighbour cells.



Once defined the numerical details about the classification schemes, we 
shall analyse the dependence on the threshold value $\lambda_{th}$ for each 
one. In the figure \ref{fig:mean_density} we show the variation of the mean 
density parameter $\delta$ with the threshold value for cells marked as one 
of the two more dominant types of environment (voids and sheets).



As was previously established by \SRKED{Hoffman et al. (2012)} and as 
can be seen in the figure \ref{fig:mean_density}, the behaviour of the 
V-web scheme is significantly more sensible to variations of the 
$\lambda_{th}$ value compared with the T-web scheme; nevertheless, the 
behaviour of the mean density parameter for voids, sheets and filaments, 
are qualitatively quite similar for the two schemes, increasing with the 
value of $\lambda_{th}$. Although we shall focus our analysis on voids 
because they are completely dominant in the visual impression of the 
cosmic web, an analogous analysis might be performed for other type of 
environments.



On cosmic scales, the presence of highly non-linear structures implies the 
existence of very vast regions with density lower than the mean 
cosmological value due to the mass conservation. That is why the visual 
impression of the cosmic web must be necessarily dominated by these 
under-dense regions. Keeping that in mind, our novel proposal is based upon
the correct quantification of these regions, so the optimal threshold 
value must be chosen such that: sheet regions do not invade real void 
regions (in such case, the mean density parameter of sheet regions would 
become negative) and void regions do not invade real sheet and filament 
regions (in such case, the mean density parameter of void regions would 
increase due to the contribution of over-dense regions). Thus, the optimal 
value is simply where the mean density parameter of sheet regions is 
null. According to this, we obtain the next optimal threshold values 
for the T-web and the V-web respectively, $\lambda_{opt}^T = 0.326$ and 
$\lambda_{opt}^V = 0.188$. To verify our analysis, we show in the figure 
\ref{fig:visual_impression} the visual impression for each defined critical 
value, and as can be seen, the chosen values reproduce properly the 
expected impression according to the density field. 



Our classification scheme may be thought as a refinement of the recent 
schemes, where the threshold value is used to taking as a free parameter, 
based on the classic methods, where the classification is performed 
based on a cut off of the density field directly \SRKED{[references here]}.
So we make use of the objectivity achieved by the analysis of the mean 
density, but keeping all the environmental information provided by the
tensorial schemes instead of the poor description provided by the density 
field.



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Method to find void regions}
\label{subsec:method_voids}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------



Following the recent work of \SRKED{Courtois et al. 2013}, we use a method 
based on a FOF algorithm to find extended regions of voids in order to
select halo systems according to the proximity to those regions. 
To achieve this, we build the input catalogue of the FOF method with the 
positions of the center coordinate of every cell marked as void according 
to the web scheme adopted; furthermore we set an adequate linking length 
to connect even diagonal neighbour cells.



Following the work of \SRKED{Forero-Romero et al. 2008}, we also perform a 
percolation analysis in order to select the best threshold parameter that
reduce percolation in cells, thereby accounting for physical void regions.
In the figure \ref{fig:percolation_analysis} we show the obtained result 
of our percolation analysis for both web schemes. In both cases it can be 
noted the volume of the largest void region is minimized and the volume 
distribution of voids is relatively flat at $\lambda_{th} = 0.0$, that 
means percolation is completely reduced for this threshold value. So 
despite of the previously established $\lambda_{th}$ optimal values for 
each scheme, we shall use $\lambda_{th} = 0.0$ just for the detection of 
void regions. Besides, due to the domination of the large scale visual 
impression by voids, it is inevitable the presence of percolation 
phenomenon, so the current chosen threshold value for percolation is 
justified because in spite of voids are necessarily connected, we are just 
interested in detecting bulk regions.



Next, we shall calculate the reduced inertia tensor of each void region 
in order to determinate their principal directions of inertia and analyse 
the size-shape distribution of voids.


%.........................................................................
%Reduced inertia tensor
\eq{ReducedIntertia}
{ \tau_{ij} = \sum_l \frac{ x_{l,i}x_{l,j}  }{R_l^2} }
%.........................................................................
where $l$ is a index associated to each cell of to the current region, 
$i$ and $j$ indexes run over each spatial direction and finally 
$R_l$ is defined as $R_l^2 = x_{l,1}^2 + x_{l,2}^2 + x_{l,3}^2$, all 
positions are measured from the respective center of mass of the region.



The eigenvalues of the reduced inertia tensor, i.e. the principal moments
of inertia, are used to quantify the shape of void regions. They are 
denoted as $\tau_1$, $\tau_2$ and $\tau_3$ such that $\tau_1 \leq \tau_2
\leq \tau_3$. In the figure \ref{fig:distro_inertia} we show the computed
distributions for $\tau_1/\tau_2$ and $\tau_2/\tau_3$, where we rather 
calculate histograms for these ratio quantities instead of each value in 
order to avoid using an arbitrary normalization. For both schemes, it can 
be noticed that the shape-distribution is completely spread out, thereby 
indicating a non-preferred geometry of void regions, which is in agreement 
with the well-established anisotropic flow of matter associated to this 
type of region \SRKED{[reference here]}. Because of that, we shall look 
for possible alignments between the plane of rotation of halo pairs and
the principal directions of inertia of the nearest void regions.



%*************************************************************************
\section{Defining Samples}
\label{section:Def_Samples}
%*************************************************************************



In order to establish an adequate set of criteria to define a LG-like 
sample in unconstrained simulations, we proceed from the the general dark 
halo catalogues, constructed using the FOF scheme with a linking length of 
$b=0.17$ and the Bound Density Maxima (BDM) scheme for halos with an 
associated overdensity value of $200$ times the critical density 
(\SRKED{[references here}). These samples are defined over all the Bolshoi 
simulation and will be referred as General Halos samples, \GHFOF and 
\GHBDM respectively\footnote{For each sample defined, there will be a FOF 
sample and a BDM sample in order to have robust results}. To be consistent 
with the mass range observationally determined of halos that host disk-form 
galaxies, we select halos in the mass range $7\times10^{11} < M_{h}/\hMsun 
< 7\times 10^{12}$, referred here as Individual Halos (\textit{IH}) samples. 



As a primal approach to define gravitational bounded halo pairs we select 
halos within the \textit{IH} sample that satisfied to be the closest to 
each other. They constitute the Pairs (\textit{P}) sample. To maintain the 
consistency with previous works regarding algorithms used for LG selection 
(\SRKED{[references here}), we define here the next list of conditions 
that have to fulfil a pair system in order to belong to the Isolated Pairs 
(\textit{IP}) sample. All these considerations are based upon the relative 
dynamics of the Milky Way and M31, and its isolation from massive 
structures:



%.........................................................................
%Isolated pairs criteria
\begin{enumerate}

\item{With respect to each halo, there cannot be any other halo within the 
mass range $7\times10^{11} < M_{h}/\hMsun < 7\times 10^{12}$ closer than 
its partner. It means that there cannot be ambiguity on the identity of
the pair members.}

\item{The relative radial velocity between the two halos must be 
negative.}

\item{The distance between the center of the two halos must be less than 
$1.0$\hMpc.}

\item{The distance to any halo more massive than any of the pair members 
cannot be less than $3$\hMpc.}

\item{The distance to cluster-like halos with masses larger than 
$7\times10^{13}$ \hMsun must be larger than $4$\hMpc.}
\end{enumerate}
%.........................................................................



Following the previous criteria established by Forero-Romero et al. 2013-1,
we define a more reduced sample, the Reduced Isolated Pairs sample 
(\textit{RIP}), as pairs that fulfil the next two extra criteria :



%.........................................................................
%Reduced Isolated pairs criteria
\begin{enumerate}

\item{The separation between the center of mass of the halos is in the 
range $700-800$kpc.}

\item{The total mass of the two halos is in the range 
$1-4\times 10^{12}/\hMsun$.}

\end{enumerate}
%.........................................................................


Finally in the table \ref{tab:Samples_Size} we show the sizes of all 
defined samples.

\section{Finding the Environment of the Local Group}
\label{sec:LGEnvironment}
%*************************************************************************



Once defined all the samples, we shall proceed to quantify the environment
by using two different approaches. The first one is by applying the 
tensorial schemes defined in the section \ref{sec:algorithms_cosmic_web} 
and then, calculating the local eigenvalues associated to each halo or halo 
pair. The second approach is complementary to the first, and consists in 
calculating the relative distance of each halo or halo pair to the nearest
void regions, thereby allowing to link the influence of voids to the 
physical properties of the samples.




%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Tensorial Schemes}
\label{subsec:tensorial schemes}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------



The advantage of using the tensorial schemes (T-web and V-web) defined in
the section \ref{sec:algorithms_cosmic_web}, lies in being able to quantify
all the local structure of the environment of halos and pair halos just 
from kinematic and dynamic properties of the matter distribution, like the
density and velocity fields. Next, we shall calculate the distributions of 
each eigenvalue for the two defined schemes and for the \textit{GH}, 
\textit{IP} and \textit{RIP} samples. In the figure 
\ref{fig:distro_cosmicweb} is shown the obtained results, where it can be 
noticed that there is a significant bias of distribution of the halo pairs 
respect to the volume cells. Furthermore, choosing the previously 
established optimal threshold value $\lambda_{opt}$ for each web scheme, 
the table \ref{tab:OccupationFractions} is built. In this has been 
tabulated the occupation fractions for the volume cells of the simulation 
and for each sample defined in the previous section 
\ref{section:Def_Samples}.

\end{center}
\end{flushleft}
\end{table}
%.........................................................................



As it was said, the selection of a optimal threshold value for each web 
scheme, according to our proposed method based upon the mean density, is 
just an approximation which reproduces properly the visual impression of 
the cosmic web, so the table \ref{tab:OccupationFractions} must not be 
interpreted rigorously. Those occupation values must be thought just as a 
comparative illustration in order to understand possible bias between the 
defined samples and the overall matter distribution of the simulation. For 
instance, for the T-web scheme, the occupation fraction of the \textit{RIP} 
sample in filament regions is larger than in sheet regions, which does not 
mean that \textit{RIP} systems lie in filaments, but those systems lie 
preferentially in higher density and non-linear regions.

  with the next values $\lambda_{th} = 0.0$, $\lambda_{th} = 
  \lambda_{opt}/2$, $\lambda_{th} = \lambda_{opt}$ and $\lambda_{th} = 
  2\lambda_{opt}$.}
