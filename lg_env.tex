\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%****************************************************************************************************

The spatial distribution of galaxies describes a web pattern, the so-called cosmic web is driven by 
gravitational instabilities. This makes that the mass assembly history of a galaxy is deeply connected 
with its position in the cosmic web. There is an extensive body of literature on the effects of the web
environment on the observable properties of galaxies. Starting from the seminal work of Dressler up to
most recent works that aim at reconstructig the dark matter distrubution of hundreds of thousands of
galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to find environmental dependences. 

In this paper we quantify the velocity shear environment of DM halo pairs representative of the LG. 
We perform this study in two kinds of cosmological simulations: unconstrained simulations from random 
phases in the initial conditions, together with constrained simulations, which have been setup as to 
reproduce the large scale structure of the local universe ($\sim 30$\hMpc around the local group) on 
scales of $\sim 5$\hMpc. 

We pay special attention to the correlation of the present velocity shear environment with the assembly 
properties of the pairs. The motivation to have that focus is that it has been previously shown that 
the LG present in three different realizations of the constrained simulations have assembly histories
biased towards early formation times and absence of major mergers (ratio 1:10) in the last $10$ Gyr.

%****************************************************************************************************
\section{The Simulations}
\label{sec:the_simulations}
%****************************************************************************************************

We use two sets of simulations two identify the possible large scale environment of the Local Group. 
This is  similar approach to the one already used by . THe first set of simulations are constrained,
that aim at reproducing the large scale environment around the local grop as described by observations.
The second simulations is an unconstrained cosmological volume that serve us as a benchmark of the 
results obtained from the constrainede realizations. In the following subsections we describe the most 
relevant charachteristics of these two simulations.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The CLUES simulations}
\label{subsec:CLUES_simulations}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

The CLUES simulations have constrained initial conditions. The design goal was being able to reproduce
in a N-body simulation the density ditribution in the local universe on scales of $\sim5$Mpc as accurate
as the observations allow. A full description of the methods and results in the CLUES project was done
by XXX, a summary  of the cosmological volumes we use in this paper was presented by Foreero-Romero et al. 2011. 

The most relevant technical details are the following. We use three DM only simulations done in cubic 
volumes of $64$\hMpc (comoving) on a side. The matter field is sampled with $1024^3$ particles, the 
integration was performed using the Tree-PM MPI N-body code Gadget2 (REF). The cosmological parameters 
are consitend with a WMAP5 and WMAP7 cosmologies with $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.28$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.72$, 
$h=0.73$, $n=0.73$ and $\sigma_{8}=0.817$ (REF KOMATSU) for the matter density, cosmological constant, 
dimensionless Hubble parameter, spectral index of primordial density perturbations and normalization for
the power spectrum. With these parameters the mass of each particle in the simulation is 
$m_{\rm p}=1.89\times 10^{7}$\hMsun.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The Bolshoi simulation}
\label{subsec:Bolshoi_simulation}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this paper we have used the FOF catalogs available from the Multidark database. We do not use the 
BDM to keep the consistency with the FOF catalogs constructed in the CLUES simulations. 

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Halos and Merger Trees}
\label{subsec:halos_merger_trees}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

We identify halos with a Friends-of-Friends (REF) algorithm. These catalogs also provide the basis for
the mass aggregation history studies. All the results presented here must be interpreted in term of
host halos, without any information of the substructure. In particular the merger of two FOF halos 
corresponds to the epoch of first overlap, and not to the fusion and/or disruption of an accreted 
sub-halo with a dominant halo. 

The linking length we use is $b=0.17$ times the mean interparticle separation, all objects with 20 
particles or more are considered a bona fide halo and are included in the construction of the merger t
ree, this corresponds to a minimum halo mass of $M_{\rm min}=3.78\times 10^{8}$\hMsun in the CLUES 
volumes and $M_{\rm min}=2.70\times 10^{9}$\hMsun in the Bolshoi simulation. 

The identification was done for 80 snapshots in the redshift range $0<z<7$.

%****************************************************************************************************
\section{The V-web}
\label{sec:Vweb}
%****************************************************************************************************

We use the a kinematical method to define the cosmic-web environment in the simulation. The method has
been thoroughly described in XXX and applied to study the shape and spin alignment in the Bolshoi 
simulation here XX. We refer the reader to these papers to find a detailed description of the algorithm,
its limitations and capabilities. Here we summarize the most relevant points for the discussion.

The V-web method for environment finding is based on the local shear tensor calculated from the smoothed 
DM velocity field in the simulation. The central quantity is the following dimensionless quantity

\eq{V_web}
{
\Sigma_{\alpha\beta} = -\frac{1}{2H_0}\pr{\frac{\partial v_{\alpha}}{\partial x_{\beta}}+\frac{\partial v_{\beta}}{\partial x_{\alpha}}}
}

where $v_{\alpha}$ and $x_{\alpha}$ represent the $\alpha$ component of the comoving velocitiy and 
position, respectively. $\Sigma_{\alpha\beta}$ can be represented by a $3\times 3$ symetric matrix with 
real values, that nesures that is possible to diagonalize and obtain three real eigenvales 
$\lambda_{1} > \lambda_{2}>\lambda_3$ whose sum (the trace of $\Sigma_{\alpha\beta}$) is proportional to 
the divergence of the local velocity field smoothed on the physical scale ${\mathcal R}$. 

The relative strength of the three eigenvalues with respect to a treshold values $\lambda_{th}$ allows 
for the local classification of the matter distribution into four web types. Voids, sheets, filaments 
and peaks, which correspond to regions with 3, 2, 1 or 0 eigenvalues with values larger than 
$\lambda_{th}$. In this paper we do not perform an definitive classification into web types, instead
we express the results respect to the relative strength of the eigenvalues and in a range of
 $\lambda_{th}$. To choose a suitable range we propose a new quantity analogous to expression 
\ref{eq:V_web}, but built with the physical velocity field $w_{\alpha}$ and physical coordinates 
$r_{\alpha}$, the physical local shear tensor, defined as

\eq{V_web_Phys}
{
\Pi_{\alpha\beta} = -\frac{1}{2H}\pr{\frac{\partial w_{\alpha}}{\partial r_{\beta}}+\frac{\partial w_{\beta}}{\partial r_{\alpha}}}
}

evaluating this quantity in current epoch, we obtain the next relation between both tensors

\eq{Rel_Tensors}
{ \Pi_{\alpha\beta} = \Sigma_{\alpha\beta} - \delta_{\alpha\beta} }

Using this relations, we can establish the two extreme $\lambda_{th}$ values to present our results. The 
first one $\lambda_{th} = 0$, it is obtained assuming that the sign of each eigenvalue indicates the
nature of collapse in the respective direction, what is valid in the strong non-linear scale where the
peculiar velocity field is mainly dominant. The upper limit $\lambda_{th} = 1$ is obtained using the same
previous argument, but using the eigenvalues of the the physical tensor, what is valid in the weak 
non-linear scale, where the hubble flow is still dominant.

We consider \textit{a posteriori} the possible web type interpretation that could be feasible within a 
range of thresholds for the eigenvalues. 

%****************************************************************************************************
\section{Definition of samples}
\label{section:Def_Samples}
%****************************************************************************************************

We define list here conditions that have to fullfil a pair of halos in a unconstrained simulation to 
be considered as LG-like. All considerations are based on the relative dynamics of the Milky Way and 
M31, and its isolation from massive strucutures:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{The Local Group is considered to be a pair of halos with dark matter masses in the range 
$5\times10^{11}<M_{h}/\hMsun < 5\times 10^{12}$.}
\item{The distance between the center of the two halos should be less than $0.7$\hMpc.}
\item{The relative physical velocity between the two halos has to be negative.}
\item{The distance to any halo more massive than any of the pair members must be less than $XX$\hMpc.}
\item{The distance to cluster-like halos with masses larger than $XX$\hMpc must be larger than 
$XX$\hMpc.}
\end{enumerate}

In the case of a constrained simulation on can include an additional constrain
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(vi)]{The Local Group pair must be located in the right environment with respect to the XX Cluster.}
\end{enumerate}

From these conditions it is possible to construct three differente samples. A sample of pairs, following
conditions 1 to 3. A second sample of isolated pairs, that additioanaly fulfill conditions 4 and 5, and
a sample third sample of LGs that fulfills condition 6. The samples of pairs and isolated pairs can be 
constructed from the Bolshoi and CLUES simulations. However, by construction, the LGs sample can only be 
extracted from the constrained simulation.

%****************************************************************************************************
\section{Construction of the experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}
%****************************************************************************************************

In this section we prepare some numerical experiments with the halos samples and their environment, 
with special emphasis on the isolated pairs and LG samples. All this in order to find for environment 
correlations and common properties between LG systems.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Comparing simulations}
\label{subsec:comparison_simulations}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

Prior to study of isolated and LG samples and to determinate possible correlations between their properties,
it is necessary to establish the equivalence between all simulations that we will use, with the aim to 
eliminate effects due to construction procces of each one.

In first place, we analyze the mass distribution of individual halos and in next figure we show the 
integrated mass function (IMF) for halos sample with $M \geq 1\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$

\begin{flushleft}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,width=0.35\textheight]{./figures/Halos_IMF.pdf}
\captionof{figure}{\small Integrated mass function of individual halos of each simulation used. 
In the center-left, with vertical dot lines, the individual masses of each LG system in CLUES 
simulations are represented.}
\label{fig:IMF_Halos}
\vspace{0.1 cm}
\end{center}
\end{flushleft}

Although in high masses the IMF of each simulation are slightly different, in low mass region, where
the most halos of our interest are, the IMFs are quite similar indicating that the sample of halos in
each simulation have the same mass distribution, while the small differences are due to finite 
size of samples. Another aspect in the figure \ref{fig:IMF_Halos} is the position of LG halos, they 
are distributed across the mass range of halos that we have set (see in section \ref{section:Def_Samples}),
indicating that there is not an apparent condition with their individual masses.


\begin{flushleft}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,width=0.35\textheight]{./figures/Pairs_IPMF.pdf}
\captionof{figure}{\small Integrated distribution of mass ratio index for isolated pairs sample (a).}
\label{fig:Index_Pairs}
\vspace{0.1 cm}
\end{center}
\end{flushleft}

The situation is quite different respect to mass ratio index of isolated pairs sample (MRI). In the figure 
\ref{fig:Index_Pairs} (a) we show the integrated distribution of MRI, where the aproximately linear
behaviour indicates an uniformly distribution. The interesting aspect here is the closeness between 
the LG sample values, indicating a possible common property in these systems, even though this could be 
established a priori by construction.
In the \ref{fig:Index_Pairs} (b) is plotted the integrated distribution of total pair mass, and again like 
the IMF, there is not a preferential value.

\

Once established the concordance between the defined samples, we proceed to analyze the distribution 
of the eigenvalue of shear velocity tensor \ref{eq:V_web}, for this we assume that the halos are good 
tracers of the environment properties and therefore we evaluate each eigenvalue in the center mass of 
each halo, mapping of this way the complete distribution (figure \ref{fig:lambda_histogram}). The 
black curves correspond to the unconstrained simulation (Bolshoi) and the color curves to the 
constrained simulations (CLUES), aditionally we calculate the cosmic variance, showed in purple curves,
dividing the Bolshoi volume in smaller parts with a size comparable to the CLUES volume ($64 h^{-1 }$ Mpc of side).
What is interesting here is the clear difference between the eigenvalues distributions of the both 
types of simulations, inclusively the constrained distributions does not match between the cosmic 
variance, indicating that although both simulations were made with the same cosmology (see subsections 
\ref{subsec:CLUES_simulations} and \ref{subsec:Bolshoi_simulation}), the constrained simulations have
a significantly different environment properties (spatial matter distribution) compared to the average
expected from a random volume with the same comoving size

\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,width=0.75\textheight]{./figures/All_Lambda_Histogram.pdf}
\caption{\small Integrated distribution of mass ratio index for isolated pairs sample (a).}
\label{fig:lambda_histogram}
\vspace{0.1 cm}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Construction of LG sample}
\label{subsec:LG_construction}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
With the aim of constructing a sample of LG systems in Bolshoi simulations, we use the eigenvalues of 
the three LG systems in each CLUES simulation and choose a range for each one based in the extreme values 
of the six halos, this with the expectation of reproducing the LG specific conditions in constrained 
simulations. This criteria can be thought as a first approximation to establish a more faithful sub-sample
into the isolated pairs. In table \ref{Tab:Lambdas_LG} we show the used extreme values for each eigenvalue
of local shear tensor.



%\begin{table}
%  \centering
%  \begin{tabular}{l | c c c} \hline
%	& $\bds{\lambda_{1}}$ & $\bds{\lambda_{2}}$  & $\bds{\lambda_{3}}$ \\ \hline
%	\textbf{Minim value} & 2.33$\times 10^{-1}$ & -2.37$\times 10^{-1}$ & -9.25$\times 10^{-1}$ \\
%	\textbf{Maxim value} & 1.74 & 2.17$\times 10^{-1}$ & -2.52$\times 10^{-1}$ \\ \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \caption{Extreme values for each eigenvalues to construct LG samples.}
%  \label{Tab:Lambdas_LG}
%\end{table}

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l | c c c} \hline
	& $\bds{\lambda_{1}}$ & $\bds{\lambda_{2}}$  & $\bds{\lambda_{3}}$ \\ \hline
	\textbf{Minim value} & 1.77$\times 10^{-1}$ & -6.29$\times 10^{-3}$ & -1.98$\times 10^{-1}$ \\
	\textbf{Maxim value} & 3.49$\times 10^{-1}$ & 1.21$\times 10^{-1}$ & -8.85$\times 10^{-2}$ \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Extreme values for each eigenvalues to construct LG samples.}
  \label{Tab:Lambdas_LG}
\end{table}

As a self-consistency test, we apply this criteria to CLUES simulations and find, on averege, three LG systems 
in each one. But to avoid confusion, we keep defining the LG sample as the three initial pairs. Finally, we
construct the LG sample of Bolshoi, where the sample size is ilustrated in Table \ref{Tab:Samples}.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Environment characterization}
\label{subsec:Env_characterization}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
Once we have established the equivalence of samples in each simulation and have defined the LG samples, 
we proceed to calculate correlations between halo samples and their environment. As was mentioned in 
section \ref{sec:Vweb}, we do not use an specific value of eigenvalue threshold $\lambda_{th}$, instead of 
this, we explore a relatively wide range of this parameter (i.e. $0 \leq \lambda_{th} \leq 1$) and calculate 
distributions respect to each eigenvalue individually.

\

At first place, we calculate the environment of each LG system in CLUES simulations, for this we use the 
$\lambda_{th}$ scheme to classify it in void, sheet, filament or knot (see \ref{sec:Vweb}), with $\lambda_{th}$
into the threshold range. Figure \ref{fig:LG_Env_CLUES} is obtained

At first place, we calculate the integrated distribution of each eigenvalue for individual halos, isolated 
pairs and LG samples. For this, we associate to each halo a value of environment (set of eigenvalues)
according to its center of mass position in a smoothed grid ($256^3$ cells for Bolshoi and $64^3$ for 
CLUES, or equivalently a resolution of $1.0 \mbox{Mpc h}^{-1} $ per cell, according to the physical size of
the pairs.)
