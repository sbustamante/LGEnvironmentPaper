1. INTRODUCTION
===============
A brief introduction to the state of previous works about the relation of 
properties of individual halos and LG-like systems with their cosmological 
environment, such as overabundance of satellite, LG kinematics, alignment 
of halos spin and shape with large scale direction (Direction in the VT-web 
scheme).


2. THE SIMULAIONS
=================
Description of each simulation. Unconstrained simulation Bolshoi and 
constrined simulations CLUES. Halos detection and Merger Trees.


3. THE V-WEB
============
Definition of Vweb (Tweb?). The optimal Lambda_th criteria based upon the 
mean density parameter?


4. DEFINITION OF SAMPLES
========================
Definition of all samples, including the LG-like sample constructed with the
range of environment values of LG system in CLUES.


5. RESULTS
==========
The principal results that we want to aim here are:
  * A comparison between CLUES and Bolshoi simulations, eigenvalues and density
    volume cells distribution.
  * The adventages of our scheme to construct the LG sample in unconstrained 
    simulations based upon the CLUES LG eigenvalues. As a first evidence of 
    this, the concordance between the size of each sample, scaling as the 
    volume of each simulation.
  * Among the differents posible correlation with the enviroment, we study 
    especially those related to kinematic properties of LG systems. For 
    example possible biases in the orbital energy, angular momentum and/or
    mass parameters distributions of pairs due to the environment selection 
    criteria.
  * We also seek for possible preferential alignments between pair systems and 
    their environment directions defined from the V-web (T-web?) scheme.
  * Finally we analyze for possible selection effects due to the environment 
    selection on the mass accretion history (MAH) of LG-like systems.


6. CONCLUSIONS
==============
Among the conclusions already obtained are
  * Both simulations present very different environment and density distribution,
    being the Bolshoi simulation, apparently more evolved (bigger density contrast
    between low density regions, as voids and sheets, and high density regions as 
    filaments and knots)
  * A coherent size of all samples, scaling with the simulation volumes.
  * There isn't an apparent correlation on the mass fraction (Ma/Mb) of pairs 
    respect to their environment, while there seems to be a correlation with the 
    total mass of the system.
  * In an analogous way, it seems to exist a selection effect in the pairs energy
    due to the cut off on their environment, while there is no effect on their 
    orbital angular momentum.
