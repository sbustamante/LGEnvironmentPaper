The influence of cosmological environment on the properties of large-scale structures has been 
extensively discussed in previous works, following this direction we aim to determinate a possible
influence on the kinematic properties of our Local Group of Galaxies. We use the Bolshoi simulation 
in the current time (z=0), with a comovil volume of 256 Mpc$^3 h^3$ and a BDM catalog of dark matter 
halos and subhalos systems. Quantification of the environment is made using the velocity tensor 
scheme (Vweb) and the potential tensor scheme (Tweb). We detect LG like systems using gravitational
isolations criteria and imposing observational constrains in the halos pair systems. To build a 
more faithful sample of LG systems we detect large-scale void regions using a FOF scheme and
select a subsample of LG systems near to those void regions. Finally we calculate the kinematic 
properties of each sample to determinate correlations with their environment selection criteria.
We find a significative bias in the radial velocity and the specific energy of LG systems, whereas 
the specific angular momentum and the tangential velocity don't seem to have important bias.
