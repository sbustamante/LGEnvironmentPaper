Notation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next, it is explained the used notation for each figure here.

**Velocity**
PecVel: Magnitude of peculiar velocity.

RadCenterPecVel: projection of peculiar velocity with respect to the unitary vector toward 
the geometric center of the nearest bulk void from the pair system.

RadCellPecVel: projection of peculiar velocity with respect to the unitary vector toward 
the nearest cell that belongs to the nearest bulk void from the pair system.

TanCenterPecVel: tangential projection of peculiar velocity with respect to the unitary 
vector toward the geometric center of the nearest bulk void from the pair system.

TanCellPecVel: tangential projection of peculiar velocity with respect to the unitary vector 
toward the nearest cell that belongs to the nearest bulk void from the pair system.


**Distance**
DistVoidCell: distance to the nearest cell that belongs to the nearest bulk void.

DistVoidCenter: distance to the geometric center of the nearest bulk void.
